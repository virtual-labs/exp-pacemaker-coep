### Procedure

1. Run pacemaker simulator and observe the monophasic stimulus pulse
2. Run pacemaker simulator and observe the biphasic stimulus pulse
3. Run pacemaker simulator and observe the stimulus pulse by varying pulse width and voltage
4. Run pacemaker simulator and observe the energy delivered from stimulus pulse

**Go to the Simulator tab for performing the simulation.**
